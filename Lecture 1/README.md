# Exercises - Lecture 1

## Exercise 1

1. Design an algorithm (on paper), which can do histogram stretching.
2. Use [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html) to see the output of gray level mapping, histograms, and thresholding.
3. Use ImageJ to improve the quality of the image 'enhance_me.jpg' (find it on Moodle).
4. Use ImageJ to improve the image 'dots.gif' so that only 28 non-connected dots remain.
5. Use ImageJ to improve the image 'paper.jpg' so that the text is black and the rest is white.
   1. If youâ€™re very savvy, consider subtracting the mean of the image before thresholding.

## Exercise 2

1. Install OpenCV if you haven't already done it
2. Make a program which loads and displays an image using OpenCV
3. Make a program which loops over each pixel and prints its value, row by row.

## Exercise 3

1. Use OpenCV to load and display a color image
2. Convert it to grayscale
   1. Using nested loops
   2. Using matrix multiplication
   3. Using the built-in OpenCV function

## Exercise 4

1. Write your own thresholding algorithm that takes a grayscale images as input. Show input and the binary output image
2. Load and threshold the two images 'thermal1' and 'thermal2' (from moodle). Then, combine the two binary images using the logic operations AND and OR (one at a time).

## Exercise 5

1. Write a function that increases the contrast of the image 'Einstein'.
